# asl-image-recognition

This project will use a CNN architecture to classify the 26 letters of the ASL alphabet along with signs for 'space', 'delete', and no sign at all.

The training and testing images came from a Kaggle dataset, and are on the repository.  Included is also a final report and slides.
